Everyone’s skin is unique so it is\n                                        important to pay attention to how your skin reacts. Patch testing is\n                                        a good way to gauge how your skin reacts to new products. To patch\n                                        test, apply the product to a small area on your skin for a few\n            days/applications.<sup>[1]</sup>\n                                    </li>\n                                </ul>\n\n                                <p class=\"paragraph\">\n                                    Now let’s jump into some treatment ingredients! Chemical exfoliants\n                                    such as AHAs and BHAs help to exfoliate dead skin cells on the surface\n                                    of the skin. They help reveal fresh, new skin and can help with acne\n          and texture.<sup>[2]</sup>\n                                </p>\n\n                                <p class=\"paragraph\">\n\n                                    <strong><center>Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)</center></strong>\n                                </p>\n\n                                <p class=\"paragraph\">\n                                    Alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs are chemical exfoliants that help to\n                                    exfoliate dead skin cells on the surface of the skin. Between AHAs and\n                                    BHAs, AHAs are gentler and not oil-soluble. AHAs work more towards the\n                                    surface of the skin than BHAs; they do not penetrate as deeply as\n                                    BHAs.

This conversion process is what\n                                    makes over-the-counter retinoids gentler than prescription strengths\n                                    retinoids such as tretinoin.

If your\n          skin is very sensitive, I would say try the Krave AHA chemical\n          exfoliant. Otherwise, feel free to try out an AHA or BHA product. The\n          most important advice I can give is to not over-do it! When I first\n          started using a BHA exfoliant, I made the mistake of using it every\n          single night. This actually made my skin worse and much more\n          irritated. If you have already tried AHA/BHA products and want to try\n          something else, retinol is a great option for you. With all\n          treatments, I personally believe it is much more beneficial to stick\n          with 1 product rather than to use a bunch of different products and\n          not know what is actually helping or hurting your skin.\n        </p>\n\n                                <p class=\"paragraph\">\n\n                                    <strong><center>Alternative Option: Skincare Reset</center></strong>\n                                </p>\n\n                                <p class=\"paragraph\">\n\n                                    If you have felt like you have tried everything possible (I felt\n                                    this), making a skincare reset might be ur best option. Bring it back\n                                    to the basics: cleanse, moisturize, apply SPF. Do this for a few weeks\n                                    or even months and see how your skin feels. Use this time to heal your\n                                    skin with hydrating, rich ingredients.
