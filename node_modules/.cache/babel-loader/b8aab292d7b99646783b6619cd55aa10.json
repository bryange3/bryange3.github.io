Damp skin may cause your acne treatment to penetrate\n                                    deeper into the skin, increasing your chances of skin irritation.\n          </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    Make sure to apply sunscreen daily!

Even if you do not use treatments, using a\n                                    sunscreen every day is beneficial for anti-aging and skin cancer\n                                    prevention.\n          </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    Treatments take time.

To patch\n                                    test, apply the product to a small area on your skin for a few\n            days/applications.<sup>[1]</sup>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n\n                            <p class=\"paragraph\">\n                                Now let’s jump into some treatment ingredients!

Between AHAs and\n                                BHAs, AHAs are gentler and not oil-soluble. AHAs work more towards the\n                                surface of the skin than BHAs; they do not penetrate as deeply as\n                                BHAs. Some AHAs include glycolic acid, mandelic acid, and lactic acid.\n                                Here’s some information on these ingredients, as explained by\n                                KraveBeauty:\n        </p>\n\n                            <p class=\"paragraph\">\n\n                                <strong><center>Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs)</center></strong>\n                            </p>\n\n                            <img\n                                class=\"sourceImage\"\n                                src=\"https://cdn.glitch.com/78720ec8-e628-459e-a15e-1a463e4dd217%2FAHAs.jpeg?v=1607826519591\"\n                            />\n\n                            <p class=\"paragraph\">\n                                Here is a great AHA for both beginners and skincare gurus:\n          <a\n                                    class=\"a\"\n                                    target=\"blank\"\n                                    href=\"https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/kale-lalu-yaha\"\n                                >KraveBeauty Kale-Lalu-yAHA ($25)</a\n                                >\n          - This is a great chemical exfoliant that contains 5.25% glycolic acid\n          and other skin-restoring ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, spinach,\n          parsley, and more.

Some over-the-counter retinoids\n                                which you can buy without a prescription include retinol,\n                                retinaldehyde, retinyl esters, and granactive retinoids.\n                                Over-the-counter retinoids go through a conversion process that\n                                converts them into retinoic acid. This conversion process is what\n                                makes over-the-counter retinoids gentler than prescription strengths\n                                retinoids such as tretinoin. Nonetheless, all retinoid types can be\n                                powerful and effective in combatting acne issues.

If your\n          skin is very sensitive, I would say try the Krave AHA chemical\n          exfoliant. Otherwise, feel free to try out an AHA or BHA product. The\n          most important advice I can give is to not over-do it! When I first\n          started using a BHA exfoliant, I made the mistake of using it every\n          single night. This actually made my skin worse and much more\n          irritated. If you have already tried AHA/BHA products and want to try\n          something else, retinol is a great option for you. With all\n          treatments, I personally believe it is much more beneficial to stick\n          with 1 product rather than to use a bunch of different products and\n          not know what is actually helping or hurting your skin.\n        </p>\n\n                            <p class=\"paragraph\">\n\n                                <strong><center>Alternative Option: Skincare Reset</center></strong>\n                            </p>\n\n                            <p class=\"paragraph\">\n\n                                If you have felt like you have tried everything possible (I felt\n                                this), making a skincare reset might be ur best option. Bring it back\n                                to the basics: cleanse, moisturize, apply SPF. Do this for a few weeks\n                                or even months and see how your skin feels. Use this time to heal your\n                                skin with hydrating, rich ingredients. This helped me a lot after\n                                over-using chemical exfoliants!\n        </p>\n\n                            <p class=\"paragraph\">\n                                Good luck and remember that skincare is a journey!
