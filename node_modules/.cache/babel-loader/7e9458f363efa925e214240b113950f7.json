I started experimenting with UI design and joined a design project through a student organization called Design Innovation. Since then, I've fell in love with the UX and product design field. I've pursued pursued student organization projects, designathons, hackathons, and internships to continue to gain experience in the field and grow in my skills.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                        I decided to transfer into Information Sciences because it better aligns with my career goals and what I want from my college education. With that being said, having years of computer science education and experiences has proved incredibly beneficial for interfacing with developers and understanding technical constraints when designing.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                        <p className=\"subsection\">\n                        📎 Moving on to my experiences and skills!\n                        </p>\n                        I'm Bryan Ge:\n                        <br />\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>sophomore studying at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</li>\n                            <li>graduating May 2023</li>\n                            <li>majoring in Information Sciences (concentrating in HCI & UX)</li>\n                            <li>minoring in Computer Science</li>\n                            <li>based in Dallas, TX & Champaign, IL</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </p>\n\n\n                    <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                        <p className=\"section\">\n                            Process\n                        </p>\n\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                        <p className=\"section\">\n                            Reflections\n                        </p>\n\n                        <h3 className=\"subsection\">\n                            I've learned how to collaborate and communicate within a cross-functional team.\n                        </h3>\n                        This included daily standup, clarifications regarding designs, creating a style sheet, and utilizing Material UI and React components for easy handoff and quick developer prototyping.\n\n                        <h3 className=\"subsection\">\n                            Being open-minded and maintaining a culture where all team members are involved increases communication and efficiency.\n                        </h3>\n\n                        <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                            I ran a mini design sprint with the developers in my team to view our product and problem space from a variety of angles.
