Since our target audience is seniors and our goal is to connect those within various medical support communities, making Nour easy-to-use and intuitive was our largest challenge. I chose to design <mark>accessibility preferences for those with visual and hearing difficulties</mark>, making our platform more inclusive than other competitors.\n\n                            <img src={accessibilitypreferences} alt=\"Accessibility Preferences\" className=\"project-img-smaller center\" />\n                        </p>\n\n                        <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                            <h3 className=\"subsection\">\n                                For easy discovery, users can hear conversations happening in rooms before joining.\n                            </h3>\n\n                            Users can discover and preview rooms one at a time.

Ideating a solution for this problem was challenging and took lots of brainstorming. We saw the rise of Clubhouse, an audio chatroom social network, in connecting people virtually, so we decided to make a version for elders that specifically focused on accessibility.\n                        </p>\n\n                        <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                            <p className=\"section\">\n                                Iteration\n                            </p>\n\n                            <h3 className=\"subsection\">\n                                After our first iteration of wireframes, I Zoom called my parents, shared my screen, and gave them remote control to walk through our prototype.\n                            </h3>\n\n                            Since we only had 24 hours for this challenge, <mark>my parents served as the closest in age group and generation to our target audience</mark>. I let my parents click away at our prototype and discovered certain areas of confusion. From this, I iterated and produced more understandable screens:\n\n                            <h3 className=\"subsubsection\">\n                                1.

Although more screens causes a longer progression and setup process, it provides <mark>more clarity on what the preferences (VoiceOver and closed captioning) mean</mark>. By separating the preferences into multiple screens, there is <mark>much less clutter on the interface</mark>, leading to <mark>easier comprehension of the visual components</mark>.\n\n                            <img src={accessibilityiterations} alt=\"Accessibility Preference Iterations\" className=\"project-img\" />\n\n                            <h3 className=\"subsubsection\">\n                                3.
