I started experimenting with UI design and joined a design project through a student organization called Design Innovation. Since then, I've fell in love with the UX and product design field. I've pursued pursued student organization projects, designathons, hackathons, and internships to continue to gain experience in the field and grow in my skills.\n\n                    <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                        I decided to transfer into Information Sciences because it better aligns with my career goals and what I want from my college education. With that being said, having years of computer science education and experiences has proved incredibly beneficial for interfacing with developers and understanding technical constraints when designing.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                        <p className=\"spotify-section my-blue\">\n                            📎 Moving on to my experiences and skills!\n                        </p>\n\n                        <hr class=\"rounded-close\" />\n\n                        <Row>\n                            <Col><img src={experiences} alt=\"Experiences Playlist\" className=\"project-img\" /></Col>\n                            <Col><img src={topskills} alt=\"Top Skills Wrapped\" className=\"project-img\" /></Col>\n                        </Row>\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                        <p className=\"spotify-section my-blue\">\n                            🎺 Why Spotify?\n                        </p>\n\n                        <hr class=\"rounded-close\" />\n\n                        <p className=\"spotify-subsection\">\n                            1.
