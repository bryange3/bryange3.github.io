Ideating a solution for this problem was challenging and took lots of brainstorming. We saw the rise of Clubhouse, an audio chatroom social network, in connecting people virtually, so we decided to make a version for elders that specifically focused on accessibility.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                        <p className=\"section\">\n                            Iteration\n                        </p>\n\n                        <h3 className=\"subsection\">\n                            After our first iteration of wireframes, I Zoom called my parents, shared my screen, and gave them remote control to walk through our prototype.\n                        </h3>\n\n                        Since we only had 24 hours for this challenge, <mark>my parents served as the closest in age group and generation to our target audience</mark>. I let my parents click away at our prototype and discovered certain areas of confusion. From this, I iterated and produced more understandable screens:\n\n                        <h3 className=\"subsubsection\">\n                            1.

Although more screens causes a longer progression and setup process, it provides <mark>more clarity on what the preferences (VoiceOver and closed captioning) mean</mark>. By separating the preferences into multiple screens, there is <mark>much less clutter on the interface</mark>, leading to <mark>easier comprehension of the visual components</mark>.\n\n                        <img src={accessibilityiterations} alt=\"Accessibility Preference Iterations\" className=\"project-img\" />\n\n                        <h3 className=\"subsubsection\">\n                            3. Less overwhelming room discovery\n                        </h3>\n\n                        I chose to have our users <mark>browse through rooms one at a time so that the interface would be less overwhelming</mark> to view and navigate. By giving a user one room to preview at a time, they would also be able to <mark>listen in on what discussions are taking place before deciding to enter the room</mark> or not.\n\n                        <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                            By having the <mark>\"next\" and \"previous\" room buttons below the room card, they can be easier labeled and tapped</mark>.

Implementing games such as Bingo or Trivia within the app and expanding to an iPad app is also something we hope to reach in the future. With all these feature updates, accessibility will be our largest priority. Designing entertainment features that are easy to understand and navigate is the largest but most necessary challenge.\n                        </p>\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p className=\"paragraph\">\n                        <p className=\"section\">\n                            What I Learned\n                        </p>\n\n                        <h3 className=\"subsection\">\n                            Accessible design is challenging but necessary.\n                        </h3>\n\n                        This was the first time that I was given a design prompt where I knew almost nothing about the target audience.
