                        Mapping Personal Carbon Footprint - little changes can make a big difference in climate change. We can all be a part of the environmental solution. Your solution may aid policy makers, scientists, businesses, government agencies, and/or individual consumers, in their global or local decision-making and plans for the future.

                            LEAF is an interactive app with the goal of educating children about what the carbon footprint is and how they can take measures directly from home.

                        Users can upload an image of their room and click on various household items in the photo to learn about the items' carbon footprint. At the end of the program, users are able to calculate their own carbon footprint, utilizing the CoolClimate carbon footprint calculator.

                        The image segmentation is done using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?blog-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blog-cards.sort-order=desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="link-underline">Amazon Rekognition</a> software which uses machine learning to identify objects in an image and provide labels for them. We used these labels to provide relevant carbon footprint reducing suggestions. For example, if there is a water bottle in the photo uploaded, LEAF would tell the user:
                        <blockquote>
                            "Ah, I see you drink from bottles like a civilized person! Just remember, these bottles do end up in landfills eventually, and producing them also takes so much energy! Try to switch to reusable bottles, if possible."
                        </blockquote>
