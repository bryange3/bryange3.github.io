                    iCloud is designed to help users securely store and sync their photos, notes, messages, and more across devices such as iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

                    Apple users can designate trusted or loved ones as legacy contacts. These legacy contacts may be able to access memorable photos and videos, important files, notes, etc.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-900">
                    To ensure a meangingful experience for all users, I accounted for different scenarios and edge cases.

                <p className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 font-serif mt-12">I reviewed my work with directors and VPs of design and engineering who supported implementing my feature in the future.</p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-900 mb-4">
                    I collaborated with senior designers, UX writers, project managers, and engineers across teams and created detailed design specifications for iOS, macOS, and web for handoff to engineering.

                <p className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 font-serif mt-8">Beyond my main enhancement, I also improved discovery of Legacy Contact via Family Checklist.</p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-900">
                    Family Sharing lets people share subscriptions, iCloud storage, device locations, and more with family.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-900 mb-4">
                    I designed the ‚ÄúAdd a Legacy Contact‚Äù suggestion in the Family Checklist, a great entry point for people who want to pass down their data to family members.

                    Understanding my feature‚Äôs place in relation to Legacy Contact, iCloud, Family Sharing, and other Apple products and services is crucial for designing an experience that fits in the Apple ecosystem.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-900">
                    Simplify to what is necessary and think about how many decisions users need to make. However, it‚Äôs ok to have a longer flow if it means clearer understanding for the user. The powerful nature of Legacy Contact should inform how easy it is for users to take certain actions.
