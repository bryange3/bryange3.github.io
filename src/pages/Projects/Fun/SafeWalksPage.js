                            Sometimes, students miss the last running bus or may need to take a walk to a location when in a dire situation. Safety is a concern, especially if it is dark outside or if a student has to walk somewhere  by themselves.

                        By walking in groups, students can feel more comfortable reaching their destinations. To combat the issue of registration of non-students, University SafeWalks requires users to sign in using a valid university email address.
