                    I designed a dashboard to help South Side Weekly effectively manage news stories and collaboration.

                <p className="text-xl text-gray-900">
                    This project was conducted at <a href="https://uiuc.hack4impact.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='secondary-link' alt="Hack4Impact">Hack4Impact</a>, a student organization at UIUC that builds software for nonprofits. I collaborated with 8 students, including a product manager, a technical lead, and software developers, to build the dashboard.
                </p>

                <p className="text-xl text-gray-900 bg-gray-200 p-4">We shipped the dashboard in February 2022 to 250+ admin and contributors at South Side Weekly! After usage, the managing director even stated he believed our dashboard could be scaled for use at other newspaper nonprofits. ðŸ˜Ž</p>


                <p className="text-xl text-gray-500 mt-16">Context</p>
                <p className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 font-serif mt-8">Every published story involves collaboration between contributors and admin.</p>
                <p className="text-xl text-gray-900">
                    Contributors volunteer on stories and admin manage them and their work. They are divided into teams based on their skills such as writing, editing, photography, fact-checking, and visual art.

                <p className="text-xl text-gray-500 mt-16">Problem</p>
                <p className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 font-serif mt-8">Managing stories across many platforms is challenging and inefficient for the admin and contributors at South Side Weekly.</p>
                <p className="text-xl text-gray-900">
                    Admin review contributorsâ€™ pitches and assign contributors to stories. Contributors request to work on stories, pitch new story ideas, and track their work. All of this happens across Slack, AirTable, forms, and email â€” leading to workflow inefficiencies for admin and contributors.
                </p>

                <img className="my-4" src={platforms} />

                <p className="text-xl text-gray-900 my-4">
                    For example, contributors view available stories in an AirTable and submit requests to work on them in a separate form. In fact, the existing process of contributors joining stories varies too: some join through Slack message and others join through email.
                </p>

                <p className="text-xl text-gray-500 mt-16">Solution</p>
                <p className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 font-serif mt-8">A dashboard that centralizes collaboration between contributors and admin and supports them in their goals.</p>
                <p className="text-xl text-gray-900">
                    Contributors discover and request to work on stories, pitch their own story ideas, and collaborate with others to cover stories. Admin review pitches, assign contributors to stories, and ensure issues are published on time.

                    <li>
                        Other teams have contributors request stories themselves and admin approve or decline. For example, writers need to be interested in the story they're writing about to create quality articles.

                    Admin see a list of stories that still need contributors to join and can click into each story's detail page to categorically see all the writers, editors, photographers, etc. assigned. They can also make assignments here.

                <p className="text-xl text-gray-900 mt-4">
                    I moved forward with this approach because:

                    Grouping contributors into teams gives admin a clearer visualization of who is working on the story, which helps admin decide who else to assign.

                    My tech lead explained that auto-save functionality for all fields on this screen would be too costly to implement, which is why he suggested separate tabs. His proposal means admin would lack the team overview and context they need to make assignment decisions.

                    I proposed laying out story details into 2 sections: what the story is about on the left and contributor/team assignment on the right.

                <p className="text-xl text-gray-900">
                    From my tech lead's proposal, I realized that we did not need every property to have auto-save. We compromised with this 2-section option which maintains the context necessary for admin, while also being more feasible to implement.
