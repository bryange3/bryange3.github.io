                    As the <b>sole designer</b> in my project team at Cargill, I lead our product's discovery, user research, wireframing, and prototyping efforts. The internship has provided me the opportunity to directly interact with clients through discovery and shadowing sessions, demos, and feedback calls. These meetings  helped me identify our problem space as well as what the client values.

                            I ran a mini design sprint with the developers in my team to view our product and problem space from a variety of angles. Collectively writing out how-might-we statements and noticing the similarities and differences in them helped us discover edge cases and potential features for our dashboard that could greatly benefit our target users.
