                        Because of the pandemic and social distancing, we decided to create a mobile app to host our social platform. Since our target audience is not as familiar with technology and can find understanding new technologies difficult, we focused on designing the most comprehensible and accessible experience possible.

                        When designing our "Clubhouse for Elders", <mark>we focused on accessibility and understandability</mark>. Since our target audience is seniors and our goal is to connect those within various medical support communities, making Nour easy-to-use and intuitive was our largest challenge. I chose to design <mark>accessibility preferences for those with visual and hearing difficulties</mark>, making our platform more inclusive than other competitors.

                        Based on our research, we decided to <mark>tackle the lack of social interaction that many home care patients face</mark>. Ideating a solution for this problem was challenging and took lots of brainstorming. We saw the rise of Clubhouse, an audio chatroom social network, in connecting people virtually, so we decided to make a version for elders that specifically focused on accessibility.

                            After our first iteration of wireframes, I Zoom called my parents, shared my screen, and gave them remote control to walk through our prototype.
                        </h3>

                        Since we only had 24 hours for this challenge, <mark>my parents served as the closest in age group and generation to our target audience</mark>. I let my parents click away at our prototype and discovered certain areas of confusion. From this, I iterated and produced more understandable screens:

                            1. Improved communication of profile code scan

                        My dad mentioned his confusion with what to do at the "login / profile code scanning" screen. I realized that I needed to make a <mark>clear indicator of the profile code being scanned</mark>.

                        Devan and I compared the two variants of the accessibility preferences progression and chose the accessibility preferences progression on the right of the image below. Although more screens causes a longer progression and setup process, it provides <mark>more clarity on what the preferences (VoiceOver and closed captioning) mean</mark>. By separating the preferences into multiple screens, there is <mark>much less clutter on the interface</mark>, leading to <mark>easier comprehension of the visual components</mark>.

                        </h3>

                        I chose to have our users <mark>browse through rooms one at a time so that the interface would be less overwhelming</mark> to view and navigate. By giving a user one room to preview at a time, they would also be able to <mark>listen in on what discussions are taking place before deciding to enter the room</mark> or not.

                        Our next steps for Nour involve <mark>testing our app on patients of elderly homes</mark>. I plan on conducting <mark>usability tests to learn how our target audience navigates the app</mark>. I will also work with the home care facilities to conduct <mark>user interviews to learn more about our users' pain points with the app</mark> and any wants that are not being fulfilled by Nour.

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            We also hope to create a <mark>backend system that allows workers at different care centers to communicate and set up timely events</mark> (games, shows, etc.). Implementing games such as Bingo or Trivia within the app and expanding to an iPad app is also something we hope to reach in the future.

                        This was the first time that I was given a design prompt where I knew almost nothing about the target audience. Building an app for people who are naturally unfamiliar with technology proved difficult. However, through online research and Medium articles, I gained some knowledge about accessible design.

                            I certainly have a lot more to learn regarding designing for all and designing inclusively, but I'm glad that this designathon gave me an introduction to it.
