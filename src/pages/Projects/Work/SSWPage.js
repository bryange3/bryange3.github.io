SSW covers politics, the arts, and issues of public interest, as well as oral histories, poetry, fiction, interviews, and artwork from local photographers and illustrators.

                            Almost all of SSWâ€™s contributors are volunteers, which makes it imperative to maintain high levels of contributor engagement and retention. The contributor dashboard is intended to accomplish this by enhancing the contributor experience through building a centralized system for onboarding volunteers, submitting pitches, allowing volunteers to pick-up pending assignments, and tracking contributions.

                            Since I joined this project in its 2nd semester, I read through the user survey and interview takeaways from the previous semester. However, I believed that more user research needed to be done to fully understand the way things currently worked at South Side Weekly.

                            <h3 className="subsection">
                                My PM and I set up a session with the client to understand what information helps admin make their pitch approval decision.
                            </h3>

                            We sat in on a meeting where admins went through an AirTable of users' submitted pitches together and made approval/declining decisions. From this session, we learned that admin tend to spend around 5 minutes per pitch doing the following:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Read the pitch title & description</li>
                                <li>Go to the directory tab to find and open the submitter's profile & LinkedIn</li>
                                <li>Discuss whether or not to approve the pitch idea</li>
                            </ul>

                            Seeing how admin were going through each pitch one by one also presented a question of whether to use cards or a table format to present the submitted pitches.

                            <h3 className="subsection">
                                We are also going to chat with a staff member and a contributor to better understand the current user flows and processes.
                            </h3>

                            In these sessions we plan to:

                                <li>Learn about the user's background with South Side Weekly.</li>
                                <li>Ask the user to go through the end-to-end process from submitting or claiming a pitch to the publication of the story.</li>
                                <li>Ask the user to share screen and observe them go through the existing platforms to show the process.</li>
                                <li>Conduct usability testing by asking the user to share screen and perform tasks on my interactive Figma prototype.</li>
