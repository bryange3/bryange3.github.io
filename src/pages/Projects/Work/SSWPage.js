SSW covers politics, the arts, and issues of public interest, as well as oral histories, poetry, fiction, interviews, and artwork from local photographers and illustrators.

                            Almost all of SSWâ€™s contributors are volunteers, which makes it imperative to maintain high levels of contributor engagement and retention. The contributor dashboard is intended to accomplish this by enhancing the contributor experience through building a centralized system for onboarding volunteers, submitting pitches, allowing volunteers to pick-up pending assignments, and tracking contributions.

                            Since I joined this project in its 2nd semester, I read through the user survey and interview takeaways from the previous semester. However, I believed that more user research needed to be done to fully understand the way things currently worked at South Side Weekly.

                            <h3 className="subsection">
                                My PM and I set up a session with the client to understand what information helps admin make their pitch approval decision.
                            </h3>

                            We sat in on a meeting where admins went through an AirTable of users' submitted pitches together and made approval/declining decisions. From this session, we learned that admin tend to spend around 5 minutes per pitch doing the following:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Read the pitch title & description</li>
                                <li>Go to the directory tab to find and open the submitter's profile & LinkedIn</li>
                                <li>Discuss whether or not to approve the pitch idea</li>
                            </ul>

                            I took insights from this session and applied to my design for the "Pitches Pending Approval" tab of the admin pitch doc. This section showcases pitches contributors have submitted and admin are able to approve or decline them from here.
