                    I've known I wanted to work in the tech space ever since elementary school. I would craft mini laptops by drawing the keyboard and screen on folded cardstock and pretend I had the latest iPhone using the packaging of my parents' iPhones.

                    For 11th and 12th grade of high school, I decided to attend the Texas Academy of Math and Science at the University of North Texas (early college dual credit high school program) to pursue computer science and ultimately a career in technology. After high school, I began my college studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a Statistics & Computer Science major.

                    At the start of college, I learned about the world of product and the various roles within product teams. I started experimenting with UI design and joined a design project through a student organization called Design Innovation. Since then, I've fell in love with the UX and product design field. I've pursued pursued student organization projects, designathons, hackathons, and internships to continue to gain experience in the field and grow in my skills.

                    <p className="paragraph">
                        I decided to transfer into Information Sciences because it better aligns with my career goals and what I want from my college education. With that being said, having years of computer science education and experiences has proved incredibly beneficial for interfacing with developers and understanding technical constraints when designing.

                            I appreciate Spotify's emphasis on success being measured in a human way: how much an intern has grown. I also believe it is important to focus on learning and seeking different ways to grow.

Work no longer feels like work and finishing the project is both rewarding and fun.
