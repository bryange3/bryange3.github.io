This past spring semester, I worked in a team with <a href="https://brinkapp.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="link-underline">Brink</a>, an election voting guide nonprofit. We built an accessible web app that serves as an election guide; the main features we provided voters include the voting checklist, ballot, and FAQ.

                        <p className="paragraph">

                            </h3>
                            According to the Election Assistance Commission, voters with disabilities were nearly twice as likely as nondisabled voters to experience problems when voting. Election webpages where voters can apply to receive mail ballots often do not accommodate tools used by people who are blind, have low vision, or cannot use keyboards or a mouseâ€¦

                            This app reduces friction for users to use their voting checklist and learn about ballot candidates. There's an emphasis on making sure everything is accessible for those with vision, hearing, and motor disabilities.

                            I conducted design explorations, noted feedback, and documented product/design decisions. I was able to iterate based on conversations with Jocelyn (my co-designer!), feedback from my technical leads and developers, and weekly org-wide design critiques. We were also able to gain insights from regular check-in calls with the <a href="https://accessibleit.disability.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="link-underline">UIUC Accessibility Information Technology Group</a> where I learned so much about accessible web design. I'm incredibly grateful to the web accessibility experts for providing their feedback and important considerations on our designs.
