                            Problem
                        </h2>
                        The existing design is not informational, user-friendly, or practical and is lacking in common features found in competing platforms. Our job is to improve the existing design's landing page, project dashboard, and coding interface as well as create designs for the account and community page.

                        </h2>
                        IDEofThings is a refreshing improvement to the original design, as it is more informational, understandable, and modern. The new interface is more appealing to students and easier to navigate. The main features include class integration, project dashboard filtering, improved coding experience, and community sharing.

                        After gathering all our research, we identified the problems with the existing design through "How Might We" statements and insight statements.

                        Each of us made low fidelity mockups of the landing page, project dashboard, and coding interface. We came together and used colored circles to mark individual features we liked and wanted to include in our design.

                        Some of the common themes with our decisions for which elements to include in our design include ease of use, visibility, and practicality. Elements such as the new project button or search bar should be easily viewable and understandable by the user. Including categories in the components pane of the coding interface creates a much cleaner and organized view compared to the old design.
                    </p>

                    <p className="paragraph">
                        For the coding interface, we identified 3 important changes to make to the old design:
                        <br /><br />1) Components pane should include categories for greater organization of components
                        <img src={category} alt="Components Categories" className="project-img-small center" />
                        <p className="image-caption smol">
                            When the "+" button is clicked, the category expands out.
                        </p>
                        <br />2) Coding pane should be height-adjustable to allow the user to see more code at once
                        <img src={drag} alt="Drag Coding Pane" className="project-img center" />
                        <p className="image-caption">
                            The coding pane on the middle-bottom of the interface can be dragged up and down to adjust its height.
                        </p>
                        <br />3) Right-side component information pane should provide more usable information
                        <img src={componentinfo} alt="Component Information Pane" className="project-img-medium center" />
                        <p className="image-caption med">
                            The component information pane enables users to change the name of each component used in their project, as well as the ability to flip connections. Users are also provided tips about the component they have selected.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                        </h2>
                        We focused on creating a project dashboard that is easy to navigate and includes features targeted towards college students and programmers. Since IDEofThings has class integration, we came up with solutions to improve the experience for students.

                        <p className="image-caption med">
                            Students are able to view which projects have been submitted for classwork and which ones have not. They can also view assignments that are due soon and whether or not they have submitted them yet. The color-coded "Submitted" and "Incomplete" markers make it easy for students to see what assignments they need to complete.

                        The community page is designed so that students will see shared projects from their classes at the top.

                        The coding interface enables users to quickly search for components, view important information about selected components, share their project to the IDEofThings community or Github, and submit their project for classwork.
