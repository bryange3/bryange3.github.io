This can be seen through the green "Submitted" label located on the bottom right of submitted projects. They can also view deadlines for assignments as well as their submission statuses. The <b>color-coded "Submitted" and "Incomplete" labels make it easy for students to see what assignments they need to complete</b>.</p>
