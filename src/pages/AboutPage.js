                            üëã Hi there! I'm Bryan Ge (he/him).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I‚Äôm a sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign graduating in May 2023. I'm studying Information Sciences, concentrating in Human Computer Interaction and User Experience, and minoring in Computer Science.

                            üöô How did I get into UX and product design?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've always been intrigued by innovations in technology and how they affects our lives. Throughout high school and college, I've sought opportunities to get into tech by learning computer science. In this journey, I became exposed to the world of product where I learned about other roles and the world of user experience and product design. Since my first design project at a student organization my freshman year, I've been hooked in the process of product research, understanding users, ideating solutions, and creating prototypes!

                        <p>
                            Currently, I am involved in Hack4Impact UIUC as a product designer and the national Hack4Impact board as a design committee member. At Hack4Impact UIUC, I'm designing a dashboard for the admin and contributors of a Chicago nonprofit newspaper, South Side Weekly. As a design committee member, I'm working on improving design culture and building resources for chapters with incubating design teams.
