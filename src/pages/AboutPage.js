I am heavily involved in the design community on campus, especially through <a className="link-underline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.designinnovationillinois.com/">Design Innovation</a> and <a className="link-underline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://wcs.illinois.edu/">Women in Computer Science</a> student organizations.
