                        üòá Hi there! I'm Bryan Ge (he/him).
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        I am a software designer who loves solving complex problems involving deep systems thinking, visual craft, and storytelling. I‚Äôm currently interning at Nice Handwriting, a digital design and strategy studio. I recently graduated from UIUC and am looking for my next design opportunity! Previously, I led and shipped projects at Apple, Amazon, Cargill, and multiple nonprofits. Here's my resume.
                    </p>

                    <h1 className="about-subtitle">
                        üé® How did I get into design?
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Since middle school, I've been intrigued by the latest innovations in technology. In college, I discovered the different roles in product and found myself loving design. Since my first project, I've been hooked in the process of understanding users, exploring different design options, and constantly iterating.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On campus, I designed and shipped software for nonprofits at Hack4Impact. I loved building meaningful products and collaborating with talented students and real clients. I also led initiatives to improve design culture across the organization: team-pair design critique, industry designer feedback, online resources, and recruitment.
