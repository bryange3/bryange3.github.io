                        üëã Hi there! I'm Bryan Ge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My pronouns are he/him and I‚Äôm a sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm studying Information Sciences and graduating in May 2023.

                        üöô How did I get into UX and product design?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've always been intrigued by technological innovations and how they affect our lives. Through learning computer science, I discovered the different roles in product and landed in design. Since my first project, I've been hooked in the creative process of understanding users and problems and constant iteration.
