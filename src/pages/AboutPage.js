                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I‚Äôm a sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science + Statistics.

                            How did I get into product design?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've always been intrigued by technology and how it affects our lives. Throughout high school and college, I've sought opportunities to learn about computer science. In this journey, I became exposed to the world of product where I learned about other product roles and the world of user experience / product design. Since my first design project at a student organization my freshman year, I've been hooked in the process of research, understanding users, and prototyping!

                        <p>
                            Currently, I am involved in Hack4Impact at the national and UIUC level. I'm a product designer for a Chicago news nonprofit, South Side Weekly and a committee member of the design and operations functions of National Hack4Impact. I'm working on growing the design community and culture at Hack4Impact. I am also a Product Designer at Connect Tutors (via Develop For Good) working on improving the tutor and student registration experience.
