                        üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è University Safewalks increases students' safety while walking on campus by connecting users with other students from their school. Walkers choose their start and destination and join walks with other students to safely get across campus.

                            Problem
                        </h3>
                        Sometimes, students miss the last running bus or may need to take a walk to a location when in a dire situation. Safety is a concern, especially if it is dark outside or if a student has to walk somewhere  by themselves.

                            Solution
                        </h3>
                        University SafeWalks connects students with each other and helps bring students walking in similar paths together. By walking in groups, students can feel more comfortable reaching their destinations. To combat the issue of registration of non-students, University SafeWalks requires users to sign in using a valid university email address.
